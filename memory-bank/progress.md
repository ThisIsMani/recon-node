# Progress Log: Smart Ledger Backend (Node.js)

**2025-05-22 (Early Morning): Refined File Ingestion Types (Removed Chargeback)**
- **Task:** Further refine the CSV file ingestion logic by removing 'Chargeback' as a directly accepted or mapped type.
- **Actions:**
    - Updated `src/server/core/staging-entry/index.js` (`ingestStagingEntriesFromFile` function):
        - Modified CSV `type` field validation to accept only 'Payment', 'Refund', 'DEBIT', 'CREDIT' (case-insensitive).
        - Removed 'Chargeback' from the explicit list of accepted types and from the internal mapping logic for determining `EntryType`.
    - Updated Memory Bank: `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and this `progress.md` file. `memory-bank/entities/staging-entries.md` will also be updated.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Key Learnings:** Iterative refinement of features based on feedback helps align the system more closely with specific requirements.

**2025-05-22 (Early Morning): Enhanced File Ingestion to Accept DEBIT/CREDIT Types**
- **Task:** Modify the CSV file ingestion logic to directly accept "DEBIT" or "CREDIT" as transaction types, in addition to existing mappings for "Payment", "Refund", and "Chargeback".
- **Actions:**
    - Updated `src/server/core/staging-entry/index.js` (`ingestStagingEntriesFromFile` function):
        - Expanded CSV `type` field validation to include 'DEBIT', 'CREDIT', and 'CHARGEBACK' (case-insensitive) as valid inputs.
        - Implemented logic to prioritize direct use of `EntryType.DEBIT` or `EntryType.CREDIT` if the CSV `type` explicitly states 'DEBIT' or 'CREDIT'.
        - Retained the fallback mechanism to determine `EntryType` based on `account.account_type` for CSV types 'Payment', 'Refund', and 'Chargeback'.
    - Updated Memory Bank: `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and this `progress.md` file. `memory-bank/entities/staging-entries.md` will also be updated.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Key Learnings:** Enhancing data ingestion flexibility can simplify input file preparation for users.

**2025-05-21 (Late Evening): Enhanced List Entries API Response**
- **Task:** Include the status of the associated transaction in the response of the "List Entries" API (`GET /accounts/{accountId}/entries`).
- **Actions:**
    - Modified `src/server/core/entry/index.js`: Updated the `listEntries` function to include the related `transaction` in the Prisma query, selecting its `status`, `transaction_id`, `logical_transaction_id`, and `version`.
    - Modified `src/server/routes/entry/index.js`: Updated the JSDoc/Swagger comments for the `GET /accounts/{accountId}/entries` endpoint to reflect the new transaction details in the response schema.
    - Investigated Swagger generation: Confirmed that Swagger docs are generated dynamically on server start via `swagger-jsdoc` and `src/config/swaggerDef.js`; no separate build script is needed. The changes will apply on the next server restart.
    - Updated Memory Bank: `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and this `progress.md` file. `memory-bank/entities/entries.md` will also be updated.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Key Learnings:** Understanding how Swagger documentation is generated and served in the project is important for ensuring API documentation stays current.

**2025-05-21 (Evening): Refined Recon Rule Selection Logic**
- **Task:** Address issue where the Recon Engine might pick an incorrect `ReconRule` if an account is associated with multiple rules. The selection needs to be context-aware based on `StagingEntryProcessingMode`.
- **Actions:**
    - Modified `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js`:
        - In `generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging` (primarily for `TRANSACTION` mode): Changed `ReconRule` query to find rules where `stagingEntry.account_id` matches `account_one_id`.
        - In `processStagingEntryWithRecon` (for `CONFIRMATION` mode): Changed `ReconRule` query to find rules where `stagingEntry.account_id` matches `account_two_id` when determining if a match attempt is warranted.
    - Updated unit tests in `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine.js` to reflect these specific rule lookups and ensure correct error messages for `NoReconRuleFoundError`.
    - All 11 tests in `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine.js` passed after changes.
    - Updated Memory Bank:
        - `memory-bank/entities/recon-engine.md`: Detailed the new rule selection logic based on processing mode.
        - `memory-bank/entities/recon-rules.md`: Clarified how rules are used depending on the processing mode.
        - `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Updated to reflect the completion of this refinement.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Key Learnings:** The importance of context-specific database queries in business logic, especially when entities can have multiple relationships or roles.

**2025-05-21: "File Type Processing Modes" Feature Completion & Bug Fixes**
- **Task:** Finalize "File Type Processing Modes" feature, diagnose and fix failing tests.
- **Actions:**
    - Added `StagingEntryProcessingMode` enum (`CONFIRMATION`, `TRANSACTION`) to `prisma/schema.prisma`.
    - Added `processing_mode` field to `StagingEntry` model (default `CONFIRMATION`).
    - Updated `POST /api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries` and `POST /api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/files` to require and handle `processing_mode`.
    - Refactored `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js` (`processStagingEntryWithRecon`):
        - `CONFIRMATION` mode: Attempts to match existing `EXPECTED` entries. Sets to `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW` if no match or invalid match.
        - `TRANSACTION` mode: Bypasses matching, calls `generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging` to prepare data, then calls `transactionCore.createTransactionInternal`. Updates `StagingEntry` to `PROCESSED` or `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW`.
    - **Bug Fix in `generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging`:** Corrected metadata construction for `expectedEntryData` to ensure all original `stagingEntry.metadata` (e.g., `payment_ref`) is spread, in addition to `order_id`, `source_staging_entry_id`, and `recon_rule_id`. Previously, only `order_id` was explicitly carried over from the destructured `stagingEntry.metadata`, causing other fields to be lost for the expected entry's metadata.
    - Updated all relevant unit tests (`tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine.js`, `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine-matching.test.js`) and API tests (`tests/staging-entry/staging-entry.js`) to incorporate and validate `processing_mode`.
    - Iteratively debugged and fixed test failures in `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine.js` related to:
        - Mock persistence across describe blocks (`jest.restoreAllMocks()` removal).
        - Precise `toHaveBeenCalledWith` assertions for `transactionCore.createTransactionInternal`, ensuring correct `version` and `metadata` (including `order_id: undefined` when appropriate) were expected for transaction shells and entries.
        - Corrected mock setup for `prisma.reconRule.findFirst` in specific test cases to ensure proper error path testing.
- **Status:** Completed. All 160 tests are passing.
- **Key Learnings:** Careful attention to mock lifecycles and precise matching of complex object arguments (including handling of undefined properties) in Jest assertions is crucial. Thorough tracing of data flow for metadata construction helped identify the subtle bug in `generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging`.

**2025-05-21: Recon Engine Consumer Polling Interval & File Ingestion API Path (Completed in previous sessions, context carried over)**
- **Task (Polling):** Change consumer polling from 5 seconds to 1 second and make it an environment variable.
    - **Actions:** Introduced `RECON_ENGINE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` env var, defaulted to 1000ms in `src/config/index.js`. Updated `src/server/core/recon-engine/consumer.js` to use this config.
    - **Status:** Completed.
- **Task (File API Path):** Refactor file ingestion API path.
    - **Actions:** Path changed from `/api/staging-entries/files/:account_id` to `/api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/files`. Updated routes, tests, and Postman collection.
    - **Status:** Completed.
