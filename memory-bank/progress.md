# Progress Log: Smart Ledger Backend (Node.js)

---
**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Implement Logger Service and Refactor Console Usage
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Created a new logger service (`src/services/logger.js`) that wraps `console` methods and allows conditional logging based on `process.env.NODE_ENV` (disabled for 'test').
- Refactored `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js` and `src/server/core/recon-engine/consumer.js` to use the new logger service instead of direct `console.log`/`console.error` calls.
- Removed `console` spies and related assertions from unit tests in `tests/recon-engine/core/engine.test.js` and `tests/recon-engine/core/consumer.js`.
- Confirmed all 126 tests pass with a clean console output.
- Updated Memory Bank: `plans/2025-05-20-logger-service-refactor.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, and this progress log.
**Issues/Notes:** None.

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Recon Engine - Phase 3: Update Consumer Logic
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Modified `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js`:
    - Added new function `processStagingEntryWithRecon(stagingEntry, merchantId)`.
    - This function calls `generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging` and `transactionCore.createTransactionInternal`.
    - It handles `NoReconRuleFoundError` and `BalanceError` by updating the `StagingEntry` status to `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW` and then re-throwing the error.
    - On successful transaction creation, it updates the `StagingEntry` status to `PROCESSED`.
- Modified `src/server/core/recon-engine/consumer.js`:
    - The `processSingleTask` function now calls `reconEngine.processStagingEntryWithRecon`.
    - It updates the `ProcessTracker` task to `COMPLETED` on success or `FAILED` if any error is thrown by `processStagingEntryWithRecon`.
    - Error handling within the consumer is now generic, relying on the engine to manage `StagingEntry` status for specific errors.
- Added unit tests for `processStagingEntryWithRecon` in `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine.js`.
- Created new test file `tests/recon-engine/core/consumer.js` with unit tests for the updated consumer logic.
- All 126 tests were passing (prior to logger refactor which maintained passing tests).
- Updated Memory Bank: `plans/2025-05-20-recon-consumer-update-v3.md`, `entities/recon-engine.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`.
**Issues/Notes:** Initial test runs after this phase showed console logs/errors; this was addressed in a subsequent logger refactoring task.

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Atomic Transaction and Entry Creation
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Defined `BalanceError` custom error in `src/server/core/transaction/index.js`.
- Refactored `createEntryInternal` to accept an optional Prisma transaction client (`tx`).
- Refactored `createTransactionInternal`:
    - Updated signature to `(transactionShellData, actualEntryData, expectedEntryData, callingTx?)`.
    - Implemented balancing check (amounts, currencies, DEBIT/CREDIT pair).
    - Wrapped DB operations in `prisma.$transaction` for atomicity.
    - Calls refactored `createEntryInternal` with the transaction client.
- Updated unit tests for `createEntryInternal` and `createTransactionInternal`. All tests pass.
- Updated Memory Bank: `entities/transactions.md`, `entities/entries.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`.
**Issues/Notes:** None.

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Recon Engine - Phase 1: Implement Core Component (`engine.js`)
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Created `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js`.
- Implemented `async function generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging(stagingEntry, merchantId)`:
  - Extracts `order_id` from `stagingEntry.metadata`.
  - Prepares "actual" entry data (status `POSTED`).
  - Finds `ReconRule` using `stagingEntry.account_id` and `merchantId`.
  - Throws `NoReconRuleFoundError` if no rule is found.
  - Generates "expected" entry data (status `EXPECTED`, contra-account from rule, mirrored financials).
  - Returns `[actualEntryData, expectedEntryData]`.
- Defined `NoReconRuleFoundError` custom error.
- Created unit tests for `generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging` in `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine.js` (filename corrected). All 6 tests pass.
- Updated Memory Bank: `recon-engine.md` (new), `index.md`, `entries.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `plans/2025-05-20-recon-engine-tests.md`.
**Issues/Notes:** None.

**2025-05-19 (Initial Setup & Merchants API):**

- **Task:** Pivot from Python/Gemini to a pure Node.js/Express/PostgreSQL backend for the Smart Ledger application. Set up the initial project structure, database connection, a `/api/health` endpoint, Merchant API, and documentation.
- **Status (End of Initial Setup & Merchants API):** Foundational setup complete. `/api/health` and `/api/merchants` functional. Documentation initialized.

---

**2025-05-19 (Transactions API Implementation - Phase 1: GET Endpoint):**

- **Task:** Define the `Transaction` model and `TransactionStatus` enum. Implement the GET API endpoint (`/api/merchants/:merchant_id/transactions`) for listing transactions, along with associated core logic, documentation, and tests. Transactions will not have a direct creation API in this phase.
- **Status:** In Progress.

---

**2025-05-19 (Entries API Implementation - Phase 1: GET Endpoint):**

- **Task:** Define the `Entry` model and `EntryStatus` enum. Implement the GET API endpoint (`/api/accounts/:account_id/entries`) for listing entries, along with associated core logic, documentation, and tests. Entries will not have a direct creation API in this phase.
- **Status:** In Progress.

---

**2025-05-19 (Accounts API Implementation):**

- **Task:** Implement the "Accounts" API (Create, List, Delete) associated with merchants.
- **Status (End of Accounts API):** Accounts API fully implemented and tested via `curl`. Schema updated, documentation (Swagger, README, Memory Bank) updated. New Cline rule for server restarts created.

---

**2025-05-19 (API Testing Setup - Jest & Supertest):**

- **Task:** Set up an automated API testing environment using Jest and Supertest for Merchants and Accounts APIs.

- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  **Planning:** Created `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-19-api-tests.md`.
    2.  **Dependencies Installed:** `jest`, `supertest`, `dotenv`, `cross-env` added as dev dependencies.
    3.  **Directory Structure:** Created `tests/merchants/` and `tests/accounts/`.
    4.  **`package.json` Updated:** Added `test` script: `cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --detectOpenHandles`.
    5.  **Test Environment:**
        - Created `.env.test` for test database `DATABASE_URL` (user confirmed manual update with correct string for `recon_node_test`).
        - Added `.env.test` to `.gitignore`.
    6.  **Jest Configuration:**
        - `jest.setup.js`: Created to load `.env.test` using `dotenv`.
        - `jest.globalSetup.js`: Created to run `npx prisma migrate reset --force --skip-seed` (using test `DATABASE_URL`) before all tests.
        - `jest.config.js`: Created to define test environment, setup files, test file matching (`**/tests/**/*.js`), and coverage options.
    7.  **Test Suites Implemented:**
        - `tests/merchants/merchants.js`: Added tests for POST (create, duplicate, bad request) and GET (list) merchant endpoints.
        - `tests/accounts/accounts.js`: Added tests for POST, GET, DELETE account endpoints, including various success and failure scenarios (e.g., non-existent parent merchant, invalid account type).
    8.  **Error Handling Refinement:** Adjusted core logic and route handlers for account creation to ensure Prisma validation errors (like invalid enum) correctly result in HTTP 400 responses. Updated corresponding tests.
    9.  **Tests Executed:** All 16 tests for Merchants and Accounts APIs passed successfully using `npm test`.
    10. **Documentation (`README.md`):** Added a section explaining how to run the tests.
    11. **Memory Bank Update (`activeContext.md`):** Updated to reflect completion of API testing setup.

- **Status (End of API Testing Setup):**
    - Automated API testing framework using Jest and Supertest is established.
    - Test suites for Merchants and Accounts APIs are implemented and passing.
    - Test database (`recon_node_test`) is automatically reset before test runs.
    - Code coverage reporting is configured.
    - Project documentation updated.

- **Issues/Challenges (API Testing Setup):**
    - One test case for invalid account type initially failed due to a mismatch between expected (500) and actual (400) status codes. This was resolved by:
        - Refining error handling in `src/server/core/account/index.js` to better classify Prisma validation errors.
        - Correcting the error message check in the `src/server/routes/account/index.js` POST handler.
        - Updating the test assertion in `tests/accounts/accounts.js` to expect HTTP 400 and the more specific error message.

- **Next Steps (from `activeContext.md` before this refactor):**
    1. This `progress.md` update (Done).
    2. Discuss and plan the database schema and APIs for "Entries" and "Transactions".
    3. Implement API endpoints for creating and managing entries and transactions.
    4. Implement logic for on-the-fly balance calculations based on entries.
    5. Write API tests for new Entry and Transaction endpoints.
    6. Address TODOs from previous phases: more robust input validation (e.g., using Joi/Zod), balance check on account deletion.

**2025-05-20 (Test Fixes & Code Coverage Improvement):**

- **Task:** Address test failures and improve code coverage across the application.
- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  **Initial Test Run & Analysis:** Ran `npm test`. Identified `TypeError` in `process-tracker` core logic due to undefined enums during tests. Noted overall code coverage at ~58%.
    2.  **Enum Import Fix (Process Tracker):** Modified `src/server/core/process-tracker/index.js` to explicitly import `ProcessTaskType` and `ProcessTaskStatus` from `@prisma/client`. This resolved the console errors.
    3.  **Core Logic Test Suite Creation & Coverage Improvement:**
        - Created `tests/merchants/core/merchants.js` (renamed from `merchants.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/merchant/index.js`. Coverage for this file reached 100%.
        - Created `tests/entry/core/entry.js` (renamed from `entry.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/entry/index.js`.
        - **Enum Import Fix (Entry):** Modified `src/server/core/entry/index.js` to explicitly import `EntryType` and `EntryStatus` from `@prisma/client`, fixing test failures. Coverage for this file reached 100%.
        - Created `tests/health/health.js` (renamed from `health.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/health.js`. Coverage for this file reached 100%.
        - Created `tests/recon-rules/core/recon-rules.js` (renamed from `recon-rules.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/recon-rules/index.js`. Coverage for this file reached 97.43%.
        - Created `tests/config/config.js` (renamed from `config.test.js`) for `src/config/index.js`.
        - **Config File Refactor & Test Fix:**
            - Modified `src/config/index.js` to parse `PORT` to an integer.
            - Removed `require('dotenv').config()` from `src/config/index.js` to improve test isolation.
            - Adjusted test expectations in `tests/config/config.js` for `config.port` type.
            - Coverage for `src/config/index.js` reached 100%.
    4.  **Test File Renaming & Path Correction:**
        - Renamed newly created unit test files to `tests/<entity>/[core/]<name>.js` (e.g., `tests/merchants/core/merchants.js`, `tests/health/health.js`).
        - Updated `require` paths within these test files to reflect their new locations.
    5.  **Test Output Cleanup:** Modified core logic test suites to use `afterEach` for `jest.restoreAllMocks()` and ensure `console.error` spies correctly suppress output during expected error path tests.
    6.  **Final Test Run:** All 11 test suites (85 tests) passed with clean console output. Overall statement coverage remains at **68.21%**.
    7.  **Memory Bank Update:** Updated `activeContext.md` and this `progress.md`.
- **Status (End of Task):**
    - All identified test failures resolved.
    - Code coverage significantly improved for several core modules.
    - Overall statement coverage is 68.21%.
    - Test console output is now clean for core logic tests.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Address remaining low code coverage areas if deemed necessary (e.g., `src/app.js`, `src/config/swaggerDef.js`, `src/db_models/index.js`).
    - Continue with Recon Engine development and testing.
