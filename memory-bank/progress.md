**Date:** 2025-05-21
**Task:** Refactor File Ingestion API Path
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Refactored the File Ingestion API endpoint path from `/api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/ingest-file` to `/api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/files`.
- Updated route definition in `src/server/routes/staging-entry/index.js`.
- Updated Swagger JSDoc comments to reflect the new path.
- Updated API tests in `tests/staging-entry/staging-entry.js` to use the new path; all 158 project tests pass.
- Updated Memory Bank documents (`entities/staging-entries.md`, `plans/2025-05-21-file-ingestion-api.md`, `activeContext.md`, and this progress entry) to reflect the new path.
**Issues/Notes:** This refactor was done to align with more common RESTful naming conventions, using a noun (`/files`) for the resource being acted upon by the `POST` method.
**Next Steps:** Refer to `activeContext.md` for broader project next steps.

**Date:** 2025-05-21
**Task:** Implement File Ingestion API for Staging Entries
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Implemented a new API endpoint `POST /api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/ingest-file` (later refactored to `/api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/files`) to allow bulk creation of `StagingEntry` records from a CSV file.
- Added `multer` and `csv-parser` dependencies for handling `multipart/form-data` and parsing CSV streams.
- **Route Handler (`src/server/routes/staging-entry/index.js`):**
    - Configured `multer` for CSV file uploads (memory storage, file type filter, size limit).
    - Added the new route, applying `multer` middleware.
    - Handles file presence validation and calls the core ingestion logic.
    - Determines response status (200 OK, 207 Multi-Status, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) based on the outcome from the core logic.
    - Added Swagger JSDoc comments for API documentation.
- **Core Logic (`src/server/core/staging-entry/index.js`):**
    - Created `ingestStagingEntriesFromFile(accountId, file)` function.
    - Fetches `Account` details (including `account_type`) for the given `accountId`.
    - Streams and parses the CSV file content using `csv-parser`.
    - For each CSV row:
        - Validates presence of required fields (`order_id`, `amount`, `currency`, `transaction_date`, `type`).
        - Validates data types (numeric amount, valid date, "Payment"/"Refund" for type).
        - Determines `StagingEntry.entry_type` (DEBIT/CREDIT) based on `Account.account_type` and the CSV `type` field.
        - Constructs the `StagingEntry` data payload, including metadata (`order_id`, `source_file`).
    - Calls the existing `createStagingEntry(accountId, payload)` for each valid, transformed row. This also triggers `ProcessTracker` task creation.
    - Aggregates results, counting successful ingestions and collecting detailed errors for failed rows (both validation and database errors).
    - Returns a summary object: `{ message, successful_ingestions, failed_ingestions, errors }`.
- **Unit/Integration Tests (`tests/staging-entry/staging-entry.js`):**
    - Added a new `describe` block for the file ingestion endpoint.
    - Tests cover:
        - Successful ingestion of a valid CSV.
        - Partial success with a CSV containing mixed valid/invalid rows (207 Multi-Status).
        - Ingestion of a CSV where all rows are invalid.
        - Requests with no file uploaded (400).
        - Requests with an invalid file type (non-CSV) (400).
        - Requests for a non-existent `account_id` (404).
    - Ensured test setup uses `AccountType.DEBIT_NORMAL` for consistency with core logic and Prisma enums.
- **Memory Bank Updates:**
    - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-21-file-ingestion-api.md` created and followed.
    - `memory-bank/entities/staging-entries.md` updated with details of the API endpoint and core function.
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` updated to reflect completion of this feature.
    - This `progress.md` entry added.
**Issues/Notes:** Initial test runs failed due to incorrect `DATABASE_URL` setup for `jest.globalSetup.js` (resolved by creating `.env.test`), incorrect Prisma enum usage in tests (resolved by using `AccountType.DEBIT_NORMAL`), and incorrect API path in tests (resolved by correcting to full nested path). Subsequent test failures related to valid rows not being processed were fixed by correcting enum comparison in core logic (`account.account_type === AccountType.DEBIT_NORMAL`). Multer error handling for invalid file types was also improved.
**Next Steps:** API path was subsequently refactored. Refer to `activeContext.md` for broader project next steps.

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Recon Engine - Phase 2: Transaction Evolution (Archival & Fulfillment)
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Enhanced `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js` (`processStagingEntryWithRecon` function):
    - When a valid match between a `StagingEntry` and an `EXPECTED Entry` occurs:
        - The `originalTransaction` (containing the `EXPECTED Entry`) is now archived (status `ARCHIVED`, `discarded_at` set).
        - A new, evolved `Transaction` is created with the same `logical_transaction_id` and an incremented `version`. This new transaction has a `POSTED` status.
        - The new transaction includes two `POSTED` entries:
            1. An entry derived from the fulfilling `StagingEntry`.
            2. An entry derived from the original `POSTED` leg of the archived transaction.
        - The `StagingEntry` is marked `PROCESSED`, and its metadata is updated with `evolved_transaction_id` and `match_type: 'Phase2_Fulfilled'`.
        - All these operations are performed atomically within a `prisma.$transaction`.
- Updated `src/server/core/transaction/index.js` (`createTransactionInternal` function):
    - Modified to correctly handle being called within an existing Prisma transaction (passed as `callingTx`) by using the provided transaction client directly for database operations, instead of trying to start a new nested `$transaction`.
- Updated unit tests in `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine-matching.test.js`:
    - "Scenario 1" now tests the full Phase 2 fulfillment flow, including transaction archival and evolution.
    - All tests in this suite (6 tests) are passing.
    - All 16 test suites (152 tests) in the project are passing.
- Updated Memory Bank: `memory-bank/entities/recon-engine.md`, `memory-bank/entities/transactions.md`, `memory-bank/entities/entries.md`, `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-20-phase2-transaction-evolution.md` (marked as complete), `activeContext.md`, and this progress log.
**Issues/Notes:**
    - Resolved a `BalanceError` in tests caused by `Decimal` comparison using `!==` instead of `comparedTo()`.
    - Resolved a `TypeError` related to `prisma.$transaction` being called on a transaction client (`tx`) by refactoring `createTransactionInternal`.
    - Resolved persistent `PrismaClientValidationError` for `account_type` in `recon-engine-matching.test.js` by ensuring correct enum usage (`AccountType.ASSET` -> `AccountType.DEBIT_NORMAL`, `AccountType.LIABILITY` -> `AccountType.CREDIT_NORMAL`) and using `write_to_file` to guarantee file state. The issue was finally resolved by correcting the `AccountType` enum values in the test setup.
**Next Steps:** The core logic for matching and fulfilling expected payments is now implemented. Further enhancements could include more complex matching rules or UI for manual review.

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Recon Engine - Phase 1: Staging Entry Core Matching Logic & Mismatch State
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Verified `TransactionStatus` enum in `prisma/schema.prisma` includes `MISMATCH`.
- Ran `prisma generate` and `prisma migrate dev` to ensure schema and client are synchronized.
- Enhanced `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js` (`processStagingEntryWithRecon` function):
    - Implemented logic to find a potential `EXPECTED` entry based on `order_id`, `account_id`, and `merchant_id`.
    - Added validation for `amount`, `currency`, and `entry_type` if a match is found.
    - If a valid match:
        - `StagingEntry` status updated to `PROCESSED`.
        - Metadata updated with `matched_transaction_id`, `matched_entry_id`, `match_type: 'Phase1_Validated'`.
        - Returns `{ status: 'MATCHED_PENDING_FULFILLMENT', ... }`.
    - If a mismatch:
        - Original `Transaction` status updated to `MISMATCH`.
        - `StagingEntry` status updated to `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW` with error details.
        - Throws an error (`Mismatch detected...`).
    - If multiple matches (ambiguous):
        - `StagingEntry` status updated to `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW`.
        - Throws an error (`Ambiguous match...`).
    - If no match: Falls back to generating a new transaction with `POSTED` and `EXPECTED` entries.
- Created unit tests in `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine-matching.test.js` covering:
    - Successful match and validation.
    - Mismatches (amount, currency, entry type).
    - No match found (fallback to new transaction).
    - Ambiguous match (multiple expected entries).
- All 6 tests in `recon-engine-matching.test.js` are now passing after resolving issues with module paths and enum usage in test setup.
- Updated Memory Bank: `memory-bank/entities/recon-engine.md`, `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-20-phase1-staging-entry-matching.md` (marked as complete), `activeContext.md`, and this progress log.
**Issues/Notes:** Encountered persistent test failures related to Prisma enum usage and module path resolution in Jest, which required multiple attempts and careful file writing to resolve.
**Next Steps:** Proceed with Phase 2: Transaction Evolution (Archival and Fulfillment).

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Implement Logger Service and Refactor Console Usage
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Created a new logger service (`src/services/logger.js`) that wraps `console` methods and allows conditional logging based on `process.env.NODE_ENV` (disabled for 'test').
- Refactored `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js` and `src/server/core/recon-engine/consumer.js` to use the new logger service instead of direct `console.log`/`console.error` calls.
- Removed `console` spies and related assertions from unit tests in `tests/recon-engine/core/engine.test.js` and `tests/recon-engine/core/consumer.js`.
- Confirmed all 126 tests pass with a clean console output.
- Updated Memory Bank: `plans/2025-05-20-logger-service-refactor.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, and this progress log.
**Issues/Notes:** None.

---
**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Recon Engine - Phase 3: Update Consumer Logic
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Modified `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js`:
    - Added new function `processStagingEntryWithRecon(stagingEntry, merchantId)`.
    - This function calls `generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging` and `transactionCore.createTransactionInternal`.
    - It handles `NoReconRuleFoundError` and `BalanceError` by updating the `StagingEntry` status to `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW` and then re-throwing the error.
    - On successful transaction creation, it updates the `StagingEntry` status to `PROCESSED`.
- Modified `src/server/core/recon-engine/consumer.js`:
    - The `processSingleTask` function now calls `reconEngine.processStagingEntryWithRecon`.
    - It updates the `ProcessTracker` task to `COMPLETED` on success or `FAILED` if any error is thrown by `processStagingEntryWithRecon`.
    - Error handling within the consumer is now generic, relying on the engine to manage `StagingEntry` status for specific errors.
- Added unit tests for `processStagingEntryWithRecon` in `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine.js`.
- Created new test file `tests/recon-engine/core/consumer.js` with unit tests for the updated consumer logic.
- All 126 tests were passing (prior to logger refactor which maintained passing tests).
- Updated Memory Bank: `plans/2025-05-20-recon-consumer-update-v3.md`, `entities/recon-engine.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`.
**Issues/Notes:** Initial test runs after this phase showed console logs/errors; this was addressed in a subsequent logger refactoring task.

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Atomic Transaction and Entry Creation
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Defined `BalanceError` custom error in `src/server/core/transaction/index.js`.
- Refactored `createEntryInternal` to accept an optional Prisma transaction client (`tx`).
- Refactored `createTransactionInternal`:
    - Updated signature to `(transactionShellData, actualEntryData, expectedEntryData, callingTx?)`.
    - Implemented balancing check (amounts, currencies, DEBIT/CREDIT pair).
    - Wrapped DB operations in `prisma.$transaction` for atomicity.
    - Calls refactored `createEntryInternal` with the transaction client.
- Updated unit tests for `createEntryInternal` and `createTransactionInternal`. All tests pass.
- Updated Memory Bank: `entities/transactions.md`, `entities/entries.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`.
**Issues/Notes:** None.

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Task:** Recon Engine - Phase 1: Implement Core Component (`engine.js`)
**Status:** Completed
**Summary:**
- Created `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js`.
- Implemented `async function generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging(stagingEntry, merchantId)`:
  - Extracts `order_id` from `stagingEntry.metadata`.
  - Prepares "actual" entry data (status `POSTED`).
  - Finds `ReconRule` using `stagingEntry.account_id` and `merchantId`.
  - Throws `NoReconRuleFoundError` if no rule is found.
  - Generates "expected" entry data (status `EXPECTED`, contra-account from rule, mirrored financials).
  - Returns `[actualEntryData, expectedEntryData]`.
- Defined `NoReconRuleFoundError` custom error.
- Created unit tests for `generateTransactionEntriesFromStaging` in `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine.js` (filename corrected). All 6 tests pass.
- Updated Memory Bank: `recon-engine.md` (new), `index.md`, `entries.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `plans/2025-05-20-recon-engine-tests.md`.
**Issues/Notes:** None.

**2025-05-19 (Initial Setup & Merchants API):**

- **Task:** Pivot from Python/Gemini to a pure Node.js/Express/PostgreSQL backend for the Smart Ledger application. Set up the initial project structure, database connection, a `/api/health` endpoint, Merchant API, and documentation.
- **Status (End of Initial Setup & Merchants API):** Foundational setup complete. `/api/health` and `/api/merchants` functional. Documentation initialized.

---

**2025-05-19 (Transactions API Implementation - Phase 1: GET Endpoint):**

- **Task:** Define the `Transaction` model and `TransactionStatus` enum. Implement the GET API endpoint (`/api/merchants/:merchant_id/transactions`) for listing transactions, along with associated core logic, documentation, and tests. Transactions will not have a direct creation API in this phase.
- **Status:** In Progress.

---

**2025-05-19 (Entries API Implementation - Phase 1: GET Endpoint):**

- **Task:** Define the `Entry` model and `EntryStatus` enum. Implement the GET API endpoint (`/api/accounts/:account_id/entries`) for listing entries, along with associated core logic, documentation, and tests. Entries will not have a direct creation API in this phase.
- **Status:** In Progress.

---

**2025-05-19 (Accounts API Implementation):**

- **Task:** Implement the "Accounts" API (Create, List, Delete) associated with merchants.
- **Status (End of Accounts API):** Accounts API fully implemented and tested via `curl`. Schema updated, documentation (Swagger, README, Memory Bank) updated. New Cline rule for server restarts created.

---

**2025-05-19 (API Testing Setup - Jest & Supertest):**

- **Task:** Set up an automated API testing environment using Jest and Supertest for Merchants and Accounts APIs.

- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  **Planning:** Created `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-19-api-tests.md`.
    2.  **Dependencies Installed:** `jest`, `supertest`, `dotenv`, `cross-env` added as dev dependencies.
    3.  **Directory Structure:** Created `tests/merchants/` and `tests/accounts/`.
    4.  **`package.json` Updated:** Added `test` script: `cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --detectOpenHandles`.
    5.  **Test Environment:**
        - Created `.env.test` for test database `DATABASE_URL` (user confirmed manual update with correct string for `recon_node_test`).
        - Added `.env.test` to `.gitignore`.
    6.  **Jest Configuration:**
        - `jest.setup.js`: Created to load `.env.test` using `dotenv`.
        - `jest.globalSetup.js`: Created to run `npx prisma migrate reset --force --skip-seed` (using test `DATABASE_URL`) before all tests.
        - `jest.config.js`: Created to define test environment, setup files, test file matching (`**/tests/**/*.js`), and coverage options.
    7.  **Test Suites Implemented:**
        - `tests/merchants/merchants.js`: Added tests for POST (create, duplicate, bad request) and GET (list) merchant endpoints.
        - `tests/accounts/accounts.js`: Added tests for POST, GET, DELETE account endpoints, including various success and failure scenarios (e.g., non-existent parent merchant, invalid account type).
    8.  **Error Handling Refinement:** Adjusted core logic and route handlers for account creation to ensure Prisma validation errors (like invalid enum) correctly result in HTTP 400 responses. Updated corresponding tests.
    9.  **Tests Executed:** All 16 tests for Merchants and Accounts APIs passed successfully using `npm test`.
    10. **Documentation (`README.md`):** Added a section explaining how to run the tests.
    11. **Memory Bank Update (`activeContext.md`):** Updated to reflect completion of API testing setup.

- **Status (End of API Testing Setup):**
    - Automated API testing framework using Jest and Supertest is established.
    - Test suites for Merchants and Accounts APIs are implemented and passing.
    - Test database (`recon_node_test`) is automatically reset before test runs.
    - Code coverage reporting is configured.
    - Project documentation updated.

- **Issues/Challenges (API Testing Setup):**
    - One test case for invalid account type initially failed due to a mismatch between expected (500) and actual (400) status codes. This was resolved by:
        - Refining error handling in `src/server/core/account/index.js` to better classify Prisma validation errors.
        - Correcting the error message check in the `src/server/routes/account/index.js` POST handler.
        - Updating the test assertion in `tests/accounts/accounts.js` to expect HTTP 400 and the more specific error message.

- **Next Steps (from `activeContext.md` before this refactor):**
    1. This `progress.md` update (Done).
    2. Discuss and plan the database schema and APIs for "Entries" and "Transactions".
    3. Implement API endpoints for creating and managing entries and transactions.
    4. Implement logic for on-the-fly balance calculations based on entries.
    5. Write API tests for new Entry and Transaction endpoints.
    6. Address TODOs from previous phases: more robust input validation (e.g., using Joi/Zod), balance check on account deletion.

**2025-05-19 (Staging Entry API Implementation):**

- **Task:** Implement the "Staging Entry" API for pre-processing financial movements.

- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  **Planning:** Followed plan `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-19-staging-entry-api.md`, updated to include `discarded_at` field.
    2.  **Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`):**
        - Added `StagingEntry` model with `staging_entry_id`, `account_id`, `entry_type`, `amount`, `currency`, `status`, `effective_date`, `metadata`, `discarded_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
        - Added `StagingEntryStatus` enum (`NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW`, `PROCESSED`) and shared `EntryType` enum (`DEBIT`, `CREDIT`).

    3.  **Migration:** Ran `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_staging_entries_table` successfully.
    4.  **Directory Structure:** Created `src/server/core/staging-entry/` and `src/server/routes/staging-entry/`.
    5.  **Core Logic (`src/server/core/staging-entry/index.js`):**
        - Implemented `createStagingEntry(account_id, entryData)`: Validates account existence, handles optional `discarded_at`.
        - Implemented `listStagingEntries(account_id, queryParams)`: Retrieves entries for a specific account, supports filtering, includes related account details.
        - (Removed `updateStagingEntryStatus` function).
    6.  **API Routes (`src/server/routes/staging-entry/index.js`):**
        - Implemented `POST /` and `GET /` (relative to `/api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries`). Router uses `mergeParams: true`. (Removed `PUT /status` endpoint).
    7.  **Main Router (`src/server/routes/index.js`):** Mounted staging entry router at `/api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries`.
    8.  **Swagger Documentation:**

**2025-05-20 (Mandatory Entry-Transaction Link):**

- **Task:** Modify the Prisma schema to make the `transaction_id` field on the `Entry` model non-optional, ensuring every entry is linked to a transaction.
- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  Updated `prisma/schema.prisma`:
        *   In `Entry` model: `transaction_id` changed from `String?` to `String`.
        *   `transaction` relation changed from `Transaction?` to `Transaction`.
    2.  Ran Prisma migration `make_entry_transaction_id_mandatory` successfully.
    3.  Reviewed core logic (`createEntryInternal`, `createTransactionInternal`) for compatibility.
    4.  Updated Memory Bank: `entities/entries.md`, `entities/transactions.md`, `activeContext.md`.
- **Status (End of Task):**
    - Schema updated and migrated. `Entry.transaction_id` is now mandatory.
    - Relevant documentation updated.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Conceptual review of tests.
    - Continue with Recon Engine development (refer to `activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-20-recon-engine-tests.md`).

**2025-05-20 (Test Fixes & Code Coverage Improvement):**

- **Task:** Address test failures and improve code coverage across the application.
- **Actions Taken:**
    1.  **Initial Test Run & Analysis:** Ran `npm test`. Identified `TypeError` in `process-tracker` core logic due to undefined enums during tests. Noted overall code coverage at ~58%.
    2.  **Enum Import Fix (Process Tracker):** Modified `src/server/core/process-tracker/index.js` to explicitly import `ProcessTaskType` and `ProcessTaskStatus` from `@prisma/client`. This resolved the console errors.
    3.  **Core Logic Test Suite Creation & Coverage Improvement:**
        - Created `tests/merchants/core/merchants.js` (renamed from `merchants.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/merchant/index.js`. Coverage for this file reached 100%.
        - Created `tests/entry/core/entry.js` (renamed from `entry.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/entry/index.js`.
        - **Enum Import Fix (Entry):** Modified `src/server/core/entry/index.js` to explicitly import `EntryType` and `EntryStatus` from `@prisma/client`, fixing test failures. Coverage for this file reached 100%.
        - Created `tests/health/health.js` (renamed from `health.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/health.js`. Coverage for this file reached 100%.
        - Created `tests/recon-rules/core/recon-rules.js` (renamed from `recon-rules.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/recon-rules/index.js`. Coverage for this file reached 97.43%.
        - Created `tests/config/config.js` (renamed from `config.test.js`) for `src/config/index.js`.
        - **Config File Refactor & Test Fix:**
            - Modified `src/config/index.js` to parse `PORT` to an integer.
            - Removed `require('dotenv').config()` from `src/config/index.js` to improve test isolation.
            - Adjusted test expectations in `tests/config/config.js` for `config.port` type.
            - Coverage for `src/config/index.js` reached 100%.
    4.  **Test File Renaming & Path Correction:**
        - Renamed newly created unit test files to `tests/<entity>/[core/]<name>.js` (e.g., `tests/merchants/core/merchants.js`, `tests/health/health.js`).
        - Updated `require` paths within these test files to reflect their new locations.
    5.  **Test Output Cleanup:** Modified core logic test suites to use `afterEach` for `jest.restoreAllMocks()` and ensure `console.error` spies correctly suppress output during expected error path tests.
    6.  **Final Test Run:** All 11 test suites (85 tests) passed with clean console output. Overall statement coverage remains at **68.21%**.
    7.  **Memory Bank Update:** Updated `activeContext.md` and this `progress.md`.
- **Status (End of Task):**
    - All identified test failures resolved.
    - Code coverage significantly improved for several core modules.
    - Overall statement coverage is 68.21%.
    - Test console output is now clean for core logic tests.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Address remaining low code coverage areas if deemed necessary (e.g., `src/app.js`, `src/config/swaggerDef.js`, `src/db_models/index.js`).
    - Continue with Recon Engine development and testing.
