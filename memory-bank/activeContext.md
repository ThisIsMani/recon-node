# Active Context: Smart Ledger Backend (Node.js) - Mandatory Entry-Transaction Link

**Current Focus:**
- Modifying the database schema and related documentation to enforce a mandatory one-to-many relationship between `Transaction` and `Entry` entities.
- Specifically, making the `transaction_id` foreign key on the `Entry` model non-optional.

**Key Decisions & Changes:**
1.  **Schema Modification (`prisma/schema.prisma`):**
    *   In the `Entry` model, `transaction_id` changed from `String?` to `String`.
    *   The `transaction` relation in the `Entry` model changed from `Transaction?` to `Transaction`.
2.  **Database Migration:**
    *   A Prisma migration (`make_entry_transaction_id_mandatory`) has been successfully applied to reflect the schema changes in the database.
3.  **Relationship Clarification:**
    *   Confirmed that the existing one-to-many relationship is desired (one `Transaction` to many `Entry` records).
    *   An `Entry` must now always belong to a `Transaction`.
    *   No new join table is being introduced.
4.  **Deletion Behavior:**
    *   Transactions are not expected to be deleted. Prisma's default `onDelete: Restrict` behavior for the relation is acceptable, which would prevent deleting a `Transaction` if it has linked `Entry` records.
5.  **Core Logic:**
    *   Existing core functions like `createTransactionInternal` (which links entries during creation) are expected to be compatible. `createEntryInternal` will now implicitly require `transaction_id`.
6.  **Memory Bank Updates:**
    *   `memory-bank/entities/entries.md` updated to reflect mandatory `transaction_id`.
    *   `memory-bank/entities/transactions.md` updated to clarify the mandatory one-to-many relationship.

**Next Steps (Immediate for this task):**
1.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to log the completion of this task.
2.  Conceptually review tests to ensure they align with the mandatory `transaction_id` on `Entry`. (No direct code changes planned unless issues are found).

**Broader Next Steps (Post this task):**
- Continue with Recon Engine development, particularly testing (as per `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-20-recon-engine-tests.md`).
- Address any further refinements or enhancements for the Recon Engine.
