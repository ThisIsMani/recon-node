# Active Context: Smart Ledger Backend (Node.js) - Recon Engine Phase 2 Complete

**Current Focus:**
- Recon Engine now sets `discarded_at` for `StagingEntry` records when they are processed (status `PROCESSED` or `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW`).
- All related unit tests (158 total) are passing.
- Memory Bank documentation for `StagingEntry` and `Recon Engine` entities updated.
- Changes committed and pushed.

**Key Decisions & Changes (StagingEntry Discard Logic):**
1.  **Recon Engine Modification (`src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js`):**
    *   The `processStagingEntryWithRecon` function was updated.
    *   In all instances where `StagingEntry.status` is set to `PROCESSED` or `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW`, the `discarded_at` field is now also set to `new Date()`.
2.  **Unit Tests Updated:**
    *   `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine-matching.test.js`: Assertions added/updated to verify `stagingEntry.discarded_at` is populated after processing in various scenarios (successful match, mismatch, no match, ambiguous match).
    *   `tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine.js`: Assertions updated in mocked calls to `prisma.stagingEntry.update` to expect `discarded_at: expect.any(Date)`.
3.  **Memory Bank Updates:**
    *   `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-21-discard-processed-staging-entries.md`: New plan file created for this task.
    *   `memory-bank/entities/staging-entries.md`: Lifecycle section updated to reflect `discarded_at` behavior.
    *   `memory-bank/entities/recon-engine.md`: Logic description updated to include setting `discarded_at`.
    *   `memory-bank/progress.md` (Will be updated to log completion of this task).
    *   This `activeContext.md` file.

**Previous Context (File Ingestion API - Still Relevant):**
- CSV File Ingestion API for `StagingEntry` creation is complete, path: `POST /api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/files`.

**Next Steps (Broader - carried over, still relevant):**
-   Consider more complex matching rules for the Recon Engine.
-   Implement logic for partial matching/fulfillment.
-   Explore N-way reconciliation scenarios.
-   Performance optimization for large datasets (especially relevant for file ingestion).
-   Develop a User Interface for managing `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW` items and visualizing reconciliation.
-   Address any remaining low code coverage areas if deemed necessary.
-   Added `start:consumer` script to `package.json` for easier execution of the Recon Engine consumer.
-   Ensured `dotenv` is initialized at the top of `src/server.js` to correctly load environment variables for the main server.
-   Updated `README.md` with instructions on how to run the Recon Engine consumer.

The CSV file ingestion API for creating Staging Entries is now implemented, tested, and refactored to use the `/files` path. This provides a bulk data entry mechanism that integrates with the existing Recon Engine pipeline.
