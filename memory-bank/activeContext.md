# Active Context: Smart Ledger Backend (Node.js) - Test and Coverage Improvements

**Current Focus:**
- Fixing test failures and improving code coverage across the application.

**Key Decisions & Changes:**
1.  **Error Resolution (`TypeError` for Enums):**
    *   Resolved `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'PROCESS_STAGING_ENTRY')` in `src/server/core/process-tracker/index.js` by explicitly importing `ProcessTaskType` and `ProcessTaskStatus` enums from `@prisma/client`.
    *   Resolved similar `TypeError`s for `EntryType` and `EntryStatus` in `src/server/core/entry/index.js` by explicitly importing these enums from `@prisma/client`.
2.  **Test Suite Additions & Enhancements:**
    *   Added new core logic test suite `tests/merchants/core/merchants.js` (renamed from `merchants.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/merchant/index.js`.
    *   Added new core logic test suite `tests/entry/core/entry.js` (renamed from `entry.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/entry/index.js`.
    *   Added new core logic test suite `tests/health/health.js` (renamed from `health.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/health.js`.
    *   Added new core logic test suite `tests/recon-rules/core/recon-rules.js` (renamed from `recon-rules.core.test.js`) for `src/server/core/recon-rules/index.js`.
    *   Added new test suite `tests/config/config.js` (renamed from `config.test.js`) for `src/config/index.js`.
3.  **Test File Renaming and Path Correction:**
    *   Renamed newly created test files to follow the convention `tests/<entity>/[core/]<name>.js`.
    *   Corrected import paths within these test files due to directory changes.
4.  **Code Coverage Improvements:**
    *   `src/server/core/merchant/index.js`: Coverage increased to 100%.
    *   `src/server/core/entry/index.js`: Coverage increased to 100%.
    *   `src/server/core/health.js`: Coverage increased to 100%.
    *   `src/server/core/recon-rules/index.js`: Coverage increased to 97.43%.
    *   `src/config/index.js`: Coverage increased to 100%.
    *   Overall statement coverage increased from ~58% to **68.21%**.
4.  **Configuration File Refactor (`src/config/index.js`):**
    *   Modified to parse `PORT` to an integer for consistency.
    *   Removed direct `require('dotenv').config()` call from the module to improve testability and rely on entry-point or test-setup loading of environment variables.
5.  **Test Fixes (`tests/config/config.test.js`):**
    *   Adjusted expectation for `config.port` to be a number after the refactor.
7.  **Test Output Cleanup:**
    *   Modified core logic test suites (`tests/merchants/core/merchants.js`, `tests/entry/core/entry.js`, `tests/recon-rules/core/recon-rules.js`, `tests/health/health.js`) to spy on and suppress `console.error` during tests that intentionally trigger error paths. This ensures a cleaner test output by hiding expected error logs.

**Next Steps (Immediate for this task):**
1.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to log the completion of this task.

**Broader Next Steps (Post this task):**
- Address remaining low code coverage areas if deemed necessary (e.g., `src/app.js`, `src/config/swaggerDef.js`, `src/db_models/index.js`).
- Continue with Recon Engine development and testing.
