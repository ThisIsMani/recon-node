# Active Context: Smart Ledger Backend (Node.js) - Recon Engine Phase 2 Complete

**Current Focus:**
- Phase 2 of the Recon Engine (Transaction Evolution: Archival & Fulfillment) is complete.
- All related unit tests (including full project test suite) are passing.
- Memory Bank documentation for this phase is updated.

**Key Decisions & Changes (Recon Engine - Phase 2 Summary):**
1.  **Recon Engine Logic (`src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js` - `processStagingEntryWithRecon`):**
    *   When a valid match between a `StagingEntry` and an `EXPECTED Entry` occurs:
        *   The `originalTransaction` is archived (status `ARCHIVED`, `discarded_at` set).
        *   A new, evolved `Transaction` is created (status `POSTED`, `logical_transaction_id` maintained, `version` incremented).
        *   The new transaction contains two `POSTED` entries: one from the fulfilling `StagingEntry`, and one carried over from the original transaction's `POSTED` leg.
        *   The `StagingEntry` is marked `PROCESSED` with metadata linking to the new `evolved_transaction_id` and `match_type: 'Phase2_Fulfilled'`.
        *   These operations are performed atomically using `prisma.$transaction`.
2.  **Transaction Core Logic (`src/server/core/transaction/index.js` - `createTransactionInternal`):**
    *   Refactored to correctly handle being called from within an existing Prisma transaction. If a `callingTx` client is provided, it's used directly for database operations; otherwise, a new `prisma.$transaction` is initiated.
    *   Corrected `Decimal` amount comparison to use `comparedTo()` instead of `!==`.
3.  **Unit Tests (`tests/recon-engine/core/recon-engine-matching.test.js`):**
    *   "Scenario 1" updated to test the full Phase 2 fulfillment flow.
    *   All 6 tests in this suite pass.
    *   All 16 test suites (152 tests) in the project pass.

**Memory Bank Updates:**
-   `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-20-phase2-transaction-evolution.md` (Plan for this phase).
-   `memory-bank/entities/recon-engine.md` (Updated with Phase 2 logic).
-   `memory-bank/entities/transactions.md` (Updated with evolution details).
-   `memory-bank/entities/entries.md` (Updated with fulfillment lifecycle).
-   `memory-bank/progress.md` (Logged completion of Phase 2).
-   This `activeContext.md` file.

**Next Steps (Broader):**
-   Consider more complex matching rules for the Recon Engine.
-   Implement logic for partial matching/fulfillment.
-   Explore N-way reconciliation scenarios.
-   Performance optimization for large datasets.
-   Develop a User Interface for managing `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW` items and visualizing reconciliation.
-   Address any remaining low code coverage areas if deemed necessary.

The core functionality for matching staging entries to expected payments and evolving the transactions accordingly is now implemented and tested.
