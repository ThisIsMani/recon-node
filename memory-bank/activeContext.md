# Active Context: Smart Ledger Backend (Node.js) - Logger Service Implementation

**Current Focus:**
- Refactoring logging to use a centralized logger service for cleaner code and test outputs.

**Key Decisions & Changes (Logger Service Refactor):**
1.  **Logger Service Creation (`src/services/logger.js`):**
    *   Created a new `logger.js` service.
    *   It provides `log`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` methods that wrap the native `console` methods.
    *   Logging is conditional: output is suppressed if `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test'`.

2.  **Refactoring Core Modules:**
    *   `src/server/core/recon-engine/engine.js`: Updated to import and use the new `logger` service instead of direct `console.log`/`console.error`. Removed previous `process.env.NODE_ENV` checks for logging.
    *   `src/server/core/recon-engine/consumer.js`: Updated to import and use the new `logger` service. Removed previous `process.env.NODE_ENV` checks for logging.

3.  **Unit Test Updates:**
    *   `tests/recon-engine/core/engine.test.js`: Removed `jest.spyOn(console, ...)` and related assertions for `console.log` and `console.error` as the logger service now handles conditional logging.
    *   `tests/recon-engine/core/consumer.js`: Removed `jest.spyOn(console, ...)` and related assertions.
    *   All tests (126 total) are passing with a clean console output.

**Memory Bank Updates:**
-   Created `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-20-logger-service-refactor.md`.
-   Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to include the new logger service pattern.
-   This `activeContext.md` file.

**Next Steps (Immediate for this task):**
1.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to log the completion of the Recon Engine Consumer update and the subsequent logger refactoring.
2.  Present the completion of the overall task (Recon Engine Consumer update including logger refactor) to the user.

**Broader Next Steps (Post this task):**
-   Consider refactoring other parts of the application to use the new logger service for consistency.
-   Continue with any further planned enhancements for the Recon Engine or related modules.
-   Address remaining low code coverage areas if deemed necessary.
