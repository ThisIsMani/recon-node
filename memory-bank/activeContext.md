# Active Context: Smart Ledger Backend (Node.js) - Recon Engine Phase 2 Complete

**Current Focus:**
- CSV File Ingestion API for `StagingEntry` creation is complete, with path refactored to `/api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/files`.
- All related unit tests (including full project test suite) are passing.
- Memory Bank documentation for this feature is updated with the new path.

**Key Decisions & Changes (File Ingestion API Summary):**
1.  **API Endpoint Refactored:** Original `POST /api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/ingest-file` changed to `POST /api/accounts/:account_id/staging-entries/files`.
    *   Accepts `multipart/form-data` with a CSV file.
    *   Parses CSV, validates rows, and transforms data to `StagingEntry` format.
    *   Determines `EntryType` (DEBIT/CREDIT) based on `Account.account_type` and CSV "type" field ("Payment"/"Refund").
    *   Calls existing `stagingEntryCore.createStagingEntry` for each valid row, which also triggers `ProcessTracker` tasks for the Recon Engine.
    *   Returns a 200 or 207 (Multi-Status) response with a summary of successful and failed ingestions.
2.  **Dependencies:** `multer` and `csv-parser` added for file handling and CSV parsing.
3.  **Core Logic (`src/server/core/staging-entry/index.js`):**
    *   New function `ingestStagingEntriesFromFile(accountId, file)` added to handle the ingestion logic.
    *   Includes fetching account details, CSV parsing via streams, row-level validation, data transformation, and calling `createStagingEntry`.
4.  **Route Handler (`src/server/routes/staging-entry/index.js`):**
    *   Uses `multer` middleware for file upload.
    *   Handles request validation (file presence) and calls the core logic.
    *   Manages response status codes (200, 207, 400, 404, 500) based on outcomes.
5.  **Unit Tests (`tests/staging-entry/staging-entry.js`):**
    *   Test suite updated for the `/files` endpoint, covering valid CSVs, mixed CSVs, invalid CSVs, file type errors, missing files, and non-existent accounts.
    *   All 158 project tests pass.
6.  **API Documentation:** Swagger JSDoc comments updated for the new `/files` endpoint path.

**Memory Bank Updates:**
-   `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-21-file-ingestion-api.md` (Original plan updated with new path).
-   `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-21-file-ingestion-api-path-refactor.md` (Plan for this refactor).
-   `memory-bank/entities/staging-entries.md` (Updated with new API endpoint path).
-   `memory-bank/progress.md` (Will be updated to log completion of this refactor).
-   This `activeContext.md` file.

**Next Steps (Broader - carried over from previous context, still relevant):**
-   Consider more complex matching rules for the Recon Engine.
-   Implement logic for partial matching/fulfillment.
-   Explore N-way reconciliation scenarios.
-   Performance optimization for large datasets (especially relevant for file ingestion).
-   Develop a User Interface for managing `NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW` items and visualizing reconciliation.
-   Address any remaining low code coverage areas if deemed necessary.
-   Added `start:consumer` script to `package.json` for easier execution of the Recon Engine consumer.

The CSV file ingestion API for creating Staging Entries is now implemented, tested, and refactored to use the `/files` path. This provides a bulk data entry mechanism that integrates with the existing Recon Engine pipeline.
