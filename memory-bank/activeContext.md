## Task: Review `package.json` Dependencies (2025-05-23)

**Status:** Completed

**Summary:**
- User requested a cleanup of old JavaScript dependencies from `package.json` after the TypeScript migration.
- Reviewed `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.
- **Dependencies:** All listed packages (`cors`, `csv-parser`, `express`, `multer`, `pg`, `swagger-jsdoc`, `swagger-ui-express`) are general Node.js libraries and remain relevant.
- **DevDependencies:** All listed packages (`@prisma/client`, various `@types/*`, `cross-env`, `dotenv`, `jest`, `prisma`, `supertest`, `ts-jest`, `ts-node`, `typescript`) are essential for the TypeScript development, build, and test workflow.

**Key Decisions & Outcomes:**
- No dependencies were identified as obsolete solely due to the TypeScript migration. All current dependencies and devDependencies appear to serve a purpose in the TypeScript project.

**Next Steps (General Project):**
- The `package.json` is considered up-to-date with respect to the TypeScript migration.
