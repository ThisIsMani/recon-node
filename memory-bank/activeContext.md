# Current Work: TypeScript Migration and Test Stability

## Overview
We've completed a full migration of the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript, including the conversion of all tests. While the source TypeScript tests are passing, we've encountered and fixed some issues with compiled JavaScript tests and TypeScript type errors.

## Recent Work

### Transaction API Enhancements (May 29, 2025)
We've enhanced the transaction system with the following improvements:

1. **Added Amount and Currency Fields**:
   - Added `amount` (Decimal) and `currency` (String) fields to the Transaction table
   - These fields are now required when creating transactions
   - Enhanced validation to ensure all entries in a transaction share the same currency

2. **Grouped Transaction List API**:
   - Modified the transaction list API to return transactions grouped by `logical_transaction_id`
   - All versions of a logical transaction are now included in each group
   - Each transaction includes `from_accounts` and `to_accounts` arrays derived from its entries

3. **Enhanced Response Structure**:
   - Transaction responses now include detailed account information for better usability
   - The grouped structure makes it easier to track transaction evolution across versions

### Test Suite Stabilization (May 23, 2025)
We've resolved issues with the tests by:

1. **Fixed Consumer Test Mocking**:
   - Updated `tests/recon-engine/core/consumer.test.ts` to use the proper mock approach
   - Replaced inline mocking with importing from the official mock file at `src/server/core/recon-engine/__mocks__/task-delegator.ts`
   - Ensured correct order of mocking before imports

2. **Fixed Entry Test TypeScript Errors**:
   - Addressed JSON handling issues with Prisma in `tests/entry/core/entry.test.ts`
   - Added proper type assertions for test data objects
   - Separated creation data from response data to match Prisma's expectations
   - Used `Prisma.JsonNull` and type assertions to fix compatibility issues
   - Used `undefined` instead of `null` for metadata where appropriate to match Prisma's type expectations

3. **General Test Strategy Improvements**:
   - Used more explicit type assertions to work around TypeScript+Prisma type challenges
   - Added better documentation comments to clarify the test approach
   - Ensured tests can run in both TypeScript via ts-jest and in compiled JavaScript form

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring test stability, especially for edge cases
- Consider additional improvements to the mocking strategy for Prisma operations
- Look for opportunities to refine the type definitions to reduce the need for type assertions
