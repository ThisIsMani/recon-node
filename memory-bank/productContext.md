# Product Context: Smart Ledger Backend (Node.js)

**User Problem:** Users (likely internal finance/operations teams) need an automated and reliable system to track the complete lifecycle of financial transactions, ensuring that all expected monetary movements are accounted for, from initial event (e.g., sale) to final settlement in the bank. This system needs to provide clarity on where funds are at each stage.

**Target Users:** Internal teams managing financial reconciliation and operations.

**User Experience (UX) Expectations (for the API):**
- The service will be interacted with via a well-defined API.
- API requests should be idempotent where appropriate (e.g., processing a settlement report).
- API responses should be structured (JSON), clear, and provide sufficient detail for diagnostics.
- The system must maintain data integrity and accuracy for financial records.
- The `/api/health` endpoint provides a basic status check of the service and its database connection.

**Core User Stories (General):**
This section will be expanded with more specific user stories in entity-specific documents (e.g., `entities/accounts.md`, `entities/merchants.md`) or as new entities (e.g., Sales, Transactions, Expectations) are developed. The overall goal is to provide a comprehensive view of financial operations.
